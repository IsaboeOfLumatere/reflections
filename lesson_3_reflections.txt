Question: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
		  your work local?

Answer: A remote repository will be extremely useful when collaborating with other
		programmers and to make sure you won't lose all your work if your computer
		decides to crash one day.


Question: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
		  Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Answer: Like committing manually instead of automatically, pulling manually allows
		each pull to be meaningful, without updating more than necessary.
